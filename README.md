#### <a name="definition">Definition</a>
Blockchain is a technology used to process any transaction of value using a decentralized (P2P to be specific) network of computers spread across the world.

#### <a name="characterstics">Characterstics:</a>
<ol>
    <li>Works by a P2P network model.</li>
    <li>A transaction is called to any procedure involing debit, credit and exchange of any entity of value, hence not limited to only financial transactions.</li>
    <li>Every transaction is secured from hacking attempts.</li>
    <li>Works on a completely decentralized design; i.e., there is NO provision to a central authority keeping track of all things.</li>
    <li>
    <li>Every computer on the P2P network shared the database of every transactions.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>Someone initiates a transaction.</li>
    <li>The transaction and user's status are validated for verification.</li>
    <li>After validation a transaction might invlove some crypto-currency like Bitcoin being used.</li
used.</li>
    <li>On successful validation a empty block is generated for the transaction.</li>
    <li>This generated block is added to the exiting blockchain of other transactions (which are not limited to only financial transactions, as a transaction could be supposed for any entity of value. <mark>Please note that in this context it's not important that how blocks are added to each blockchain and how each block stores the transactions of the users; what important is that each block stores some transactions which are added to the blockchain.</mark>)</li>
    <li>Once written to the block the transaction is complete and immutable to any kind of changes.</li
